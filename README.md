# 🧠 AI Python Journey

Welcome to my personal learning journey in Python and Artificial Intelligence.

This repository documents my progress as I build foundational skills in Python, data science, and machine learning. I'm learning through self-study, hands-on projects, and public documentation.

---

## 🚀 Goal

To gain practical knowledge and confidence in building AI/ML solutions – from basic scripting to real-world applications.

---

## 📌 Focus Areas

- Python fundamentals
- Data manipulation with `pandas` and `numpy`
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Intro to machine learning using `scikit-learn`
- Small end-to-end AI projects
